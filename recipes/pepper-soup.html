		<h2>AUTHOR NOTES</h2>
		<p>In the southern Niger Delta where I was born and raised, pepper soup is not pepper soup without a mix of spices—erhe (calabash nutmeg), urheri (grains of Selim), alligator pepper (grains of paradise), umilo (cocoplum) and gbafilo (rough-skinned plum). Growing up, my grandma, mum and I would toast, grind, and blend these spices from scratch, yielding a powder that’s at once bitter, sweet, herby, and astringent. Now that I’m older, I buy a pre-toasted and -blended mix from Warri that very closely resembles the blend my grandmother used to make.

<p>>Pepper soup is the only traditional “drinking’ 
	soup” in Nigeria and though it is called pepper soup,
	 itss name hearkens more to its spiciness for which “pepper” is the closest word
	  in traditional Nigerian languages from where it is translated. 
	  I sometimes make a cold version, served in a mug laced with honey and heady with fresh lime juice,
	   perfect for hot weather.</p>

<p>This recipe will make extra spice mix, which is not only good for future pepper soups, 
   but for ukodo—a pottage based on pepper soup that gets thickened with yam,
	 plantains, or other tubers, too.</p> 

<p>The pepper soup spice mix will keep in an airtight jar in a cool pantry (or the freezer) for several months.</p>
