    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My first experience of afia efere (white soup) was at my uncles wedding some few years ago and boy did I enjoy it? I loved every bit of it. Everyone wanted to have a taste of afia efere also called white soup at the engagement party, it was a hit. I asked my sister in-law for the recipe and she was really happy to share it with me. I would want to believe white soup is prepared in different ways going by the bit of research I made. The key ingredients are pounded yam (as thickener), ogiri which can be substituted with dawadawa or iru (locust beans), Adrian fruits and pepper soup spice.</p>

    <br><h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Habanero/Rodo (adjust to your preference)</li>
        <li>2 Slices Yam (cooked and pounded or potato/poundo)</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Red pepper flaked/dry pepper</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons Ground crayfish</li>
        <li>¼ Cup onion (chopped)</li>
        <li>2-3 Tablespoons Ogiri/Iru (I used Iru; locust beans)</li>
        <li>1/2 Teaspoon Uzazi seeds or leaves</li>
        <li>1-1.5 Tablespoons Utazi leaves/fresh parsley (I used both)</li>
        <li>3 Ehuru (calabash nutmeg seeds; about ½ teaspoon)</li>
        <li>1/2 Teaspoon Uda seeds</li>
        <li>Seasoning powder/cubes</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 Fresh fish (cut into steak, gutted and cleaned)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> the thickener: Peel the yam cut into chunks then boil until soft then pound; you can use a blender/food processor/food processor/mortar and pestle then set aside. Make sure your pounded yam is not too thick so it will dissolve easily. I usually store my yam in the freezer in case if you're wondering why the yam looks dry...lol</li>

        <li> Cut the fish, remove the guts then clean. For easy cleaning, pour hot water over the fish for a few minutes about 5minutes is okay, remove and use like bread knife or blunt knife to scrape off the slime afterward rinse very cold water several times.</li>
