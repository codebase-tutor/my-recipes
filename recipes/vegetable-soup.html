		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			Vegetable soup is paired with any of the swallows in Nigeria and served as either lunch or dinner. This recipe shows you how to cook a healthy soup with vegetables (ugu and water leaves) the Nigerian way.
		</p>
		<p>I love this soup for many reasons:</p>
		<p>
			For starters, I made it with vegetables, and those are synonymous with health.
		</p>
		<p>
			In Nigeria, we combine different vegetables to make different soups.
			Okra soup, Afang soup and even edikaikong are different combinations of different veggies.
		</p>
		<p>Veggies are good for the heart and body cells.</p>
